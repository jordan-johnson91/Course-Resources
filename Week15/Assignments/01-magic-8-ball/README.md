# Magic 8-Ball

## Overview

Create a webpage that acts like a magic 8-ball.

## Tasks

### Required Tasks

- [ ] Yak Shaving
  - [ ] A repository that contains an `index.html` file and (optionally) a `js` file and/or `css` file
- [ ] 8-ball page
  - [ ] **Shake** button that gets a new phrase from the 8-ball
  - [ ] The phrase should be chosen randomly from an array of phrases

### Stretch Tasks

- [ ] Dramatic pause before showing phrase
- [ ] Animate the 8-ball shaking/phrase appearing
- [ ] Make the phrase disappear automatically after 5 seconds
- [ ] Use CSS to make the app look way cooler

## Details

Create a magic 8-ball webpage, powered by JavaScript.

The page should consist of a place where a phrase will appear, and a **shake** button that will cause a phrase to appear.

### Stretch Tasks

The required tasks of this assignment will lead to a very bare-bones 8-ball. You can use CSS and more JavaScript to make this pretty cool, though.

## Hints

Use IDs to signify special elements in your html, and use `document.getElementById` to target that element. You can change the contents with the `innerHTML` property.

Play around in the console to investigate the properties of elements that are modifiable.
